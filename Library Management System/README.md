# Library Management System  
## Introduction  
The Library Management System is a software solution designed to automate and streamline the daily operations of a library. This system allows librarians and users to efficiently manage books, including borrowing, returning, and tracking available titles. It also provides user registration, authentication, and a structured way to handle user borrowing limits and book availability.  

## Features  
- **Search for books** by title, author, or genre to check their availability.  
- **Borrow books** if they are available and within the userâ€™s borrowing limit.  
- **Return borrowed books**, updating the system to reflect the returned status.  
- **View a list of currently borrowed books**, helping users keep track of their due dates.  

## Key Features  
- **User Authentication**: Ensures only registered users can access the system by requiring login credentials.  
- **Book Search**: Allows users to search for books in the library database by various criteria like title, author, or subject.  
- **Book Borrowing/Returning**: Tracks which users have borrowed which books and limits borrowing based on availability and user limits.  
- **Borrowed Books List**: Displays a personalized list of books a user has currently borrowed, including due dates.  
- **Database Management**: Maintains records of books, users, and transactions to keep the system up-to-date.
